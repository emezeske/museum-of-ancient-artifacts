Random, unorganized code that I've written since I was around 17.

Maybe at some point I'll try to organize this in terms of when various bits were written, but for now it's just a big disorganized blob of random source files I've saved over the years.

I expect that much of this stuff doesn't work, and the stuff that does work is probably hard to get to compile.
