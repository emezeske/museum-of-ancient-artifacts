1) Create a function that, given two audio files, can determine how similar they are.
    o Sliding Fast Fourier Transform window?
    o Hidden Markov Model?

2) Create an algorithm for randomly mutating a given particle string's parameters.
    o Only change one feature at a time?
    o Provide a way to specify how much change should take place?

3) Create an evolutionary algorithm to attempt to match the string parameters against a real string sound.
